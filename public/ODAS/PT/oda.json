Well, it turns out unbearably hot temperatures take moisture from the ground, which helps lightning from storms to create a spark that starts the whole vegetation.<br><br> At the same time, in China, the population had to deal with power cuts. In (10)addition, the drought affected crop production not only there, but worldwide. <br><br>When temperatures increase, the possibilities of flood increase with them. Areas like Pakistan and New Zealand were devastated by floods this year. In Asia, dry periods have lately occurred at critical planting times, while (15)surprising downpours have destroyed homes and drowned out entire crops. This is a clear example of how global warming has totally affected communities of all sizes.<br><br>The burning of fossil fuels traps the heat in the atmosphere, which probably has been the main cause of human-induced climate change. <br><br>(20) As a society, it is advisable to explore the 2030 Agenda and to take action. On the contrary, the temperatures will continue rising and it will become unbearable to live on the only planet we know has the perfect conditions for us, the human race. Furthermore, the effects of increasing heat on the body, make it difficult for humans to maintain a safe body temperature. (25)People working outdoors are unquestionably more at risk. <br><br>It is time to accept that even the richest countries have limited means to solve these problems. Countries are forced to select between building some parts of their areas again or to develop better ways to cope with future climate crises. <br><br>The shortage of water and food will not help humanity to stop polluting the (30)world, which causes global warming.

While having one, you may experience racing heartbeat, dizziness, lack of air, (5)trembling and muscle tension. Panic attacks have different durations; they can go from a few minutes up to thirty minutes. While panic attacks last less than one hour, their effects on a person may last for a few hours (when referring to physical and emotional effects). <br><br>Another way of calling a panic attack is an “anxiety attack”. Up to 35% of the (10)population experience a panic attack at some time in their lives.<br><br>To avoid further complications, it is crucial to get treatment for this.  For instance, it is said that a person who experiences recurring panic attacks has a panic disorder. Panic disorders are related to anxiety disorders.<br><br>Some challenges that can be faced by people who suffer from this are (15)associated with the inconveniences that come from having one: breathing difficulties, accelerated heart rate, tense muscles, a dry mouth, hot flushes and more. For instance, something as simple as having a conversation or driving, becomes a complex task. <br><br>When panic attacks happen more than once, it is important to go back to the (20)drawing board and to detect what is causing such high levels of anxiety. Since having this problem is not necessarily related to stressful situations, it is interesting to mention that stress-free situations, such as watching T.V. may trigger a panic attack. Living with this might be a tall order. <br><br>The recommendation is to always seek medical advice before you do (25)something else. Doctors help you make sure that any recurring symptoms are not due to other illnesses, such as diabetes, asthma, hyperthyroidism, cardiac complaints and more.<br><br>Stress and anxiety are a big part of panic attacks. Knowing that, it is key to remember that everybody has their own ways of coping with both of them. For (30) instance, some people may find painting relaxing. Others look for interesting readings to keep themselves away from situations that might cause problems.Yoga, pilates and mindfulness are trendy tools that keep their users in a better mood. Personally, I am on cloud nine whenever I ride a bike. So, for the sake of everyone, know yourself better and find ways (35)to detect difficulties on time. "},

                 "text": "When we are little, all we hear is about how good sports are and how nice it is to choose a physical activity that we enjoy. Regularly, during childhood, the most common options are: soccer, basketball, volleyball, ballet and karate. But as we grow up, we discover the pleasure (or the lack of it) for other activities. For instance, (5)jumping in an individual trampoline is a friendly cardio that provides a full body workout in 40 minutes. Another example is indoor cycling, which gives you the opportunity to increase your heart rate and to have fun at the same time. Both options are considered to have low impact on the knees area (which is a conflictive body part as people get older). Like those activities, we may find an infinite set of (10) options that make our inner child feel delighted and healthy at the same time. But, what is the downside? There is a big difference between being athletic and suffering from bigorexia. <br><br><br><br>Bigorexia or muscle dysmorphia can be defined as a mental disorder in which the person perceives that their body looks different than it does. It is “less muscular” than (15)it actually is. This leads to obsessive and unhealthy behaviors, it mainly causes compulsive exercising and eating disorders, but it may also include the use of anabolic steroids. <br><br><br><br>Bigorexia can “appear” in different stages of life, nevertheless, it most often develops in late adolescence. Bigorexia is associated with anxiety and depression, eating (20)disorders, substance abuse and general problems (mainly with school, work and relationships).<br><br><br><br>One study found that 33% of boys ages 11-18 were not satisfied with their body shape. In addition, there are a lot of undiagnosed people suffering from muscle dysmorphia, a situation which increases in society. According to data, a study found (25) that people who had adverse childhoods, have a considerable chance of getting muscle dysmorphia later on. <br><br><br><br>Video games, social media, and, in general, the Internet keep the idea of extremely muscular men quite present in our daily lives. This fact keeps males too focused on unreachable physical goals. The way male action figures are presented are not (30)humanly possible.<br><br><br><br>Social media makes comparisons easier. The use of hashtags and the efficiency of artificial intelligence provide exactly what we think we need the most and also, probably what affects us in a deeper way. Considering the amount of “before and after” testimonies that are all over the net, accepting our body shape and genes (35)becomes next to impossible.<br><br><br><br>Educating society and reducing social media time can help. According to the American Psychological Association, people who reduce their social media time by 50% tend to have notable improvement in the way they feel about their overall appearance. Creating awareness about the strong problems most youngsters are (40) going through would certainly make it easier for society to lend a hand to people who may be struggling with muscle dysmorphia and any other mental disease.  <br><br><br><br>While bigorexia is more common in males, anorexia is more common in females. Anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight that focuses on an intense fear of gaining weight. What bigorexia and anorexia may have (45) in common are the distorted perceptions those who suffer from them have by looking at themselves in the mirror. Additionally, in an unconscious way, subjects damage their bodies by taking their “wishes” to the extreme. Furthermore, people who have these disorders do not accept themselves and most likely suffer from low self-esteem, even if it does not look like that to the “simple eye”. Moreover, both (50)disorders regularly start during adolescence. Bigorexia and anorexia may cause or be caused, up until some point, because of stress and anxiety.  <br><br><br><br>Anorexia patients can also be helped in a similar way bigorexia patients do. Everything can be traced back to society and to society’s good or bad education. As well, a high level of emotional intelligence can be key towards allowing those who (55) are close to diagnosed people to improve their behaviors around them. To make them feel more comfortable and probably even, to cope with their situations in a better, more productive way.  Teaching children about different body types, tolerance and the beauty in diversity will certainly help create another future for the upcoming generations."},
